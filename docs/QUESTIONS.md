#### Is Roc production ready?

Yes. Schibsted is currently running products in production built with Roc.

#### Is Roc a boilerplate generator?

No. Think of Roc as a complete toolchain that enables you to create a type of npm package that is CLI-powered and configurable. Any required boilerplate or glue-code is included within this package. This allows you to re-use awesome things you build from various npm packages. Simplified Roc could be described as a framework-builder, where the building blocks are modules from npm. Roc extensions are npm modules with superpowers.

#### Where can I read more about how Roc works

We have compiled an overview <a href="/docs/">here</a> on this website. Please do check it out.

#### Will this be abandoned in the near future?

No. Schibsted developed Roc because it was badly needed. It is a big investment for us. We will only consider abandoning the project if better initiatives emerge with more traction.
