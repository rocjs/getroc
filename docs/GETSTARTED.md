# Getting started with Roc

This guide will walk you through how to set up your first project using React. This is just one example on how an application can be created. More guides and and documentation is on the way.

## Install
Make sure you have Node.js 4.x or higher and npm 3.x or higher on your system.

__Currently only supported in Mac and Linux.__

```
npm install -g roc
```
`roc` will now be available globally on your system.

## Create new Redux and React project
Create directory for your app:
```
mkdir react-app && cd react-app
```
Bootstrap app starting point:
```
roc init web-react
```
### Tip
`web-react` is an alias to `vgno/roc-base-web-react`, a [repository location](https://github.com/vgno/roc-template-web-react) on Github. This template then uses the [roc-web-react](https://github.com/vgno/roc-web-react) extension. You can use your own repository by running `roc init GITHUB_USER/REPO`.

You _can_ create your own extensions but that is outside the scope of this guide.

## Development mode
```
roc dev
```
While this command is running the following is at your disposal:
- See your app running at http://localhost:3002 with Browsersync support.
- Manage your BrowserSync instance at http://localhost:3003. Connect as many different devices as you like.
- Live reloading is active, and code can be live-edited and will be live-pushed to your browser.

## View (dynamic) configuration options
```
roc dev --help
```

This prints all options that you can use to configure your current application. They are defined by the extensions that we use; currently `roc-web-react` in this guide. The runtime `cli` parameters are compatible with permanent values in `roc.config.js`.

## Default project structure
The basic template defines this for you, but you may modify it to use an entirely different structure easily through `roc.config.js`.

Roc does not enforce any set structure on you and can be configured.
```
├── app
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── content
│   │   │   ├── index.js
│   │   │   └── style.scss
│   ├── redux
│   │   └── reducers.js
│   ├── routes
│   │   └── index.js
│   └── screens
│       ├── app
│       │   ├── index.js
│       │   └── style.scss
│       ├── about
│           └── index.js
│           └── style.scss
├── public
│   └── favicon.png
├── roc.config.js
├── README.md
└──  package.json
```

`app/components` - components of the application  
`app/redux` - source related to data flow  
`app/routes` - react router mapping  
`app/screens` - components mapped to routes
`public` - files served directly from web server  
`roc.config.js` - application configuration  
`package.json` - `npm` package data

## Default project configuration
This configuration is the default one generated by `roc-template-web-react`.
```
module.exports = {
    config: {
        applicationName: 'chosen title',
        port: 3000,
        serve: ['public', 'build/client'],
        favicon: 'favicon.png',
        build: {
            reducers: 'app/redux/reducers.js',
            routes: 'app/routes/index.js'
        }
    }
};
```

## Change application configuration
Permanent configurations belonging to your application should be defined in `roc.config.js`.

Temporary configuration changes can be done using the cli as seen from `roc dev --help`.

## Build production bundles
```
roc build
```

## Start production bundles
```
roc start
```

# Additional documentation

## How to: add a component
For now please look at the code, a more detailed example is coming.

## How to: add a route
For now please look at the code, a more detailed example is coming.

## How to: modify elements in document `<head>`
`roc-web-react` uses React Helmet. You may use this to modify the appropriate settings easily from your components or by using the configuration. Please see [React Helmet´s documentation](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet#react-helmet) or use `roc dev --help`.
